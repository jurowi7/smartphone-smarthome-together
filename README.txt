Using smart phone and smart home data to predict someone's actions

There are two main folders in this project, Example Smarthome Dataset and PredictUserActions.  

Example Smarthome Dataset contains data collected as part of a masters thesis including environmental, object, and wearable data in a smarthome environment. This data is an example of the kind of data needed to predict a user's location, actions, and movement. It also includes an article about using an Android device to predict actions. For this project I used an iPhone.

PredictUserActions contains the Xcode project files and can be opened in Xcode. Xcode is used for developing Apple apps, the app I created is designed for iPhone (specifically iPhone 6, iOS 9). The project has several files that are written in the Objective-C language.
