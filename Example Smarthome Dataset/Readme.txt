- Original data consists of three types of data: Wearable, Environmental and Object. This data is stored in "Env+Obj+Wearable" folder.

- Wearable data has been filtered out for annotation. As a result, annotated data consists of only Environmental and Objects sensors. It can be found in folder: "Annotated (Env+Obj)".

- In order to read and parse the data, the data timestamp can be used to match sensor events between the annotated data and the original data.
