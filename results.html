        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Running this program using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm made it possible to predict a user's actions with fairly accurate results.</p>

        <p>Accuracy improves by adding more training data, increasing the number of k-nearest neighbor results to compare, and adding training data for multiple scenarios such as the person having the phone in their left or right pocket, face up or face down, etc.</p>

        <h3>Future Work</h3>
        <p>By adding another smart wearable device such as a smartwatch you could gather even more data relating to someones health or actions. Many smartwatches now contain heart rate monitors and as more smart health monitors are created they could provide valuable information for tracking a user's health in addition to actions.</p>

        <p>There's also a potential for using this to track children and their activities, though for practical use a different design of wearable technology may be needed since it is uncommon for infants and young children to have smartphones or smartwatches.</p>
